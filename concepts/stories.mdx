A **Story** in repr is a narrative summary of a set of code changes. It transforms raw git commits into something human-readable.

## What's in a Story?

A story consists of:
- **Summary**: A one-line title (e.g., "Implemented OAuth2 authentication").
- **Content**: A detailed description of the work, generated by an LLM.
- **Metadata**:
  - Associated repository
  - Date range
  - Commit SHAs
  - Files changed / Lines of code

## How Stories are Created

Stories are generated via the `repr generate` command.

1. **Selection**: Repr selects a batch of commits (either from the queue or a date range).
2. **Analysis**: The diffs are analyzed to understand *what* changed and *why*.
3. **Generation**: An LLM (Local or Cloud) writes the narrative based on a specific [Template](/concepts/templates).
4. **Storage**: The story is saved as a Markdown file in `~/.repr/stories/`.

## Privacy

Stories are stored locally by default. They are only uploaded to the cloud if you explicitly run `repr push` or `repr sync`.
