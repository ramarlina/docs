Templates determine how the LLM writes your story. Repr comes with several built-in templates designed for different audiences.

## Built-in Templates

### `resume` (Default)
Focuses on **impact** and **action verbs**. Great for portfolios and performance reviews.
- **Style**: Professional, concise, results-oriented.
- **Example**: "Optimized database query performance by 40%..."

### `changelog`
Focuses on **technical details**. Good for release notes.
- **Style**: Bullet points, grouped by Added/Changed/Fixed.
- **Example**: "Fixed race condition in user session handling."

### `narrative`
Focuses on the **journey**. Good for blog posts or detailed engineering logs.
- **Style**: Paragraphs, storytelling, problem-solving context.
- **Example**: "We started by identifying a bottleneck in the rendering pipeline..."

### `interview`
Focuses on the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
- **Style**: Structured sections, highlighting personal contribution.
- **Example**: "**Situation:** API latency was high. **Action:** Implemented caching..."

## Usage
