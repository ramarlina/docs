Here's the thing about tracking your work: if it takes more than 5 seconds, you won't do it. You're busy shipping code, not maintaining a work journal.

Repr solves this by making tracking **invisible**. Once you set it up, it just works in the background. Here are three ways to fit repr into your daily flow, from fully automatic to totally manual.

## Option 1: Set It and Forget It (Recommended)

Install git hooks once. From then on, every commit you make gets silently queued for story generation—no interruptions, no network calls, just quiet tracking.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install hooks everywhere">
    One command to install hooks in all your tracked repos:

    ```bash
    repr hooks install --all
    ```

    That's it. Now when you run `git commit`, repr adds that commit to a local queue in the background. You won't even notice it happening.

    **What gets sent where?** Nothing. The hook just writes to `~/.repr/queue` on your machine. No network activity.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate stories when you're ready">
    At the end of your day (or week, or whenever), turn the queue into stories:

    ```bash
    repr generate --local
    ```

    Repr reads the queued commits, groups related work, and generates professional summaries using your local LLM.

    ```text
    Processing 23 queued commits...
    
    myproject (12 commits) → 3 stories
      • Built OAuth2 integration with Google and GitHub providers
      • Implemented Redis caching for session management  
      • Fixed race condition in authentication flow
    
    frontend-app (11 commits) → 2 stories
      • Redesigned settings page with improved UX flows
      • Added dark mode toggle with system preference detection
    
    ✓ Generated 5 stories
    ✓ Cleared queue
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and approve">
    New stories are marked as "needs review" by default. Check them out:

    ```bash
    repr stories --needs-review
    ```

    Or use the interactive review flow:

    ```bash
    repr review
    ```

    You'll be walked through each story with options:

    ```text
    Story 1/5: Built OAuth2 integration with Google/GitHub

    OAuth2 integration supporting Google and GitHub providers with 
    PKCE flow for enhanced security. Implemented token refresh logic
    and proper error handling for expired credentials.
    
    Technologies: Python, OAuth2, Redis
    
    [a] Approve  [e] Edit  [r] Regenerate  [d] Delete  [s] Skip  [q] Quit
    ```

    Press `a` to approve, `e` to edit in your `$EDITOR`, or `r` to regenerate with different context.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** Run `repr generate` on Friday afternoons. Review your week's work in 2 minutes, then export it as your weekly update for your manager or team.
</Tip>

## Option 2: Quick Morning Standup

Don't want hooks? No problem. Use repr as your standup prep tool.

```bash
repr standup
```

This gives you a quick summary of the last 3 days—perfect for answering "what did you work on yesterday?"

```text
📊 Work since last 3 days (17 commits)

myproject (12 commits):
  • Add user authentication flow
  • Fix session timeout bug  
  • Implement rate limiting middleware
  • Update API documentation
  
frontend-app (5 commits):
  • Add loading states to forms
  • Fix responsive layout on mobile

Total: 17 commits across 2 repos
```

**This is just a preview**—it doesn't save anything. But if you like what you see:

```bash
repr standup --save
```

Now it's a permanent story in your `~/.repr/stories` folder.

## Option 3: End-of-Day Capture

Maybe you don't want automatic hooks, but you do want to capture your work at the end of each day. That's the sweet spot for a lot of people.

```bash
# See what you did today
repr since "this morning"
```

Output:
```text
Today's work (8 commits):

myproject:
  • Implement password reset flow
  • Add email verification
  • Fix CORS headers for production
  
frontend-app:
  • Update user profile UI
  • Add avatar upload
```

Like what you see? Save it:

```bash
repr since "this morning" --save
```

Or get even more specific:

```bash
# Work since Monday
repr since "monday" --save

# Just this week
repr since "1 week ago" --save

# Specific date range
repr since "2026-01-01" --save
```

## Which Workflow Should You Use?

Here's how to think about it:

| Workflow | Best For | Time Investment |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Hooks (automatic)** | People who want zero friction | 1 min setup, then nothing |
| **Standup** | People who like morning rituals | 30 seconds daily |
| **End-of-day** | People who batch work at day's end | 2 minutes daily |

The honest truth? Most people start with standup, realize they want it automated, and switch to hooks. But all three work great—pick what fits your style.

## What Happens Next?

Once you've got stories being generated regularly, you can:

- **Weekly review**: Use [Weekly Reflection](/guides/weekly-reflection) to curate and polish your best work
- **Interview prep**: Generate [STAR-format stories](/guides/interview-prep) for behavioral interviews
- **Publishing**: (Optional) [Share your profile](/guides/publishing) on repr.dev

The key is: **start capturing now**. Future you will thank present you when it's time to update your resume, prep for a review, or answer "what have you been working on?"
