You've got a big interview coming up. You know they're going to ask behavioral questions like "Tell me about a time you solved a complex technical problem" or "Describe a situation where you had to make trade-offs."

You *have* good stories. You know you do. But when you try to remember them on the spot? Brain fog.

Here's the secret: **Your git history is full of interview stories.** You just need to extract them in the right format. That's where repr comes in.

## The Interview Template

Repr has a special template that formats your work in the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result)—exactly what interviewers are trained to look for.

Let's generate some.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate interview-ready stories">
    Use the `interview` template to create STAR-formatted narratives:

    ```bash
    repr generate --template interview --local
    ```

    Repr will analyze your commits and structure them for behavioral interviews:

    ```text
    Generating interview stories (local LLM)...
    
    Processing commits with STAR format...
    
    myproject → 3 stories
      • Built OAuth2 integration to improve authentication security
      • Fixed critical race condition affecting 8% of users
      • Implemented Redis caching reducing API latency by 40%
    
    ✓ Generated 3 interview stories
    ✓ Formatted in STAR structure
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="See what you got">
    List your stories and pick one to review:

    ```bash
    repr stories
    ```

    Then view the full story:

    ```bash
    repr story view 01ARYZ6S41TSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV
    ```

    Here's what an interview-formatted story looks like:

    ```markdown
    **Situation:** The authentication system was experiencing race 
    conditions under high load. About 8% of login attempts were 
    failing intermittently, causing support tickets and user 
    frustration. The issue was particularly bad during peak hours 
    (9am-11am EST).

    **Task:** I needed to identify the root cause of the failures, 
    implement a fix without disrupting the existing session 
    management system, and ensure the solution could handle 10x our 
    current traffic.

    **Action:** I used distributed tracing to identify that the race 
    condition occurred during concurrent Redis operations when 
    creating new sessions. I implemented distributed locking using 
    Redis SETNX with proper timeout handling and exponential backoff 
    for retries. I also added comprehensive monitoring and alerting 
    so we'd catch similar issues faster in the future.

    **Result:** Authentication failures dropped from 8% to less than 
    0.1%. Average login latency improved by 20ms. We handled Black 
    Friday traffic (5x normal load) with zero auth-related incidents. 
    The monitoring system I added caught two other race conditions in 
    unrelated systems within the next month.

    Technologies: Python, Redis, OpenTelemetry, Datadog
    ```

    Notice how it's not just "what you did"—it's the **full narrative** with context, challenges, and measurable impact.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Polish with interview context">
    The LLM got you 80% of the way there. Now add the details that will really sell it in an interview.

    ```bash
    repr story edit 01ARYZ6S41TSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV
    ```

    Add things like:
    - **Team dynamics** - Did you work alone or collaborate?
    - **Time pressure** - Was this a week-long project or a 2-day firefight?
    - **Business impact** - What was at stake? Revenue? User trust?
    - **Trade-offs** - What did you *not* do and why?
    - **What you learned** - Interviewers love this

    Example additions:
    ```markdown
    **Context:** This was a two-person effort—I handled the backend 
    while Sarah worked on frontend error handling. We had 3 days 
    before a major product launch.

    **Trade-offs:** I considered switching to a distributed lock 
    manager like etcd, but that would have added operational 
    complexity. We chose to use Redis (already in our stack) with 
    good monitoring instead.

    **What I learned:** The importance of distributed tracing for 
    debugging race conditions. Before this, I would have been stuck 
    reading logs for days.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark your strongest stories">
    Some stories are just better than others. Feature your top 3-5:

    ```bash
    repr story feature 01ARYZ6S41TSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV
    ```

    These will show up first in your exports and on your profile.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export your interview cheat sheet">
    Create a markdown file you can review before interviews:

    ```bash
    repr profile export --format md > interview-prep.md
    ```

    Now you've got a document with 5-10 polished stories, all formatted perfectly for behavioral questions. Print it out, save it to your phone, or just review it the morning of your interview.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pro Tips for Better Interview Stories

### Focus on Impact and Leadership

Tell repr what kind of stories you want:

```bash
repr generate --template interview --prompt "Focus on leadership, technical decision-making, and cross-team collaboration"
```

The custom prompt guides the LLM to emphasize those aspects in your stories.

### Filter by Technology Stack

Applying to a Python role? Generate stories that highlight Python work:

```bash
# Generate stories from your Python repos
repr repos list | grep python
repr generate --repo ~/code/python-api --template interview

# Or filter after generation
repr stories --json | jq '.[] | select(.technologies | contains(["Python"]))'
```

### Target Your Most Impressive Projects

Don't generate from *everything*. Pick your 2-3 best repos:

```bash
repr generate --repo ~/code/complex-distributed-system --template interview
repr generate --repo ~/code/high-traffic-api --template interview
```

Quality over quantity. Five great stories beat twenty mediocre ones.

### Practice the STAR Format

Once you have your stories, **actually practice saying them out loud**. The STAR format gives you the structure, but you need to be able to deliver it naturally.

Time yourself. A good STAR story takes 90-120 seconds to tell. If you're going over 2 minutes, you're giving too much detail. Under 60 seconds? Add more context.

## Common Interview Questions & Your Stories

Here's how to map your repr stories to common behavioral questions:

| Interview Question | Story Type to Use |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "Tell me about a technical challenge you overcame" | Any story with **Action** focused on problem-solving |
| "Describe a time you had to make trade-offs" | Stories where you mention **alternatives considered** |
| "How do you handle tight deadlines?" | Stories with **time pressure** in the Situation |
| "Tell me about a project you're proud of" | Your **featured stories** with strong Results |
| "Describe a time you failed" | Look for stories with **challenges** or **what you learned** |
| "How do you collaborate with other teams?" | Stories mentioning **collaboration** in Action |

The beauty of having 10+ stories ready? You can pick the perfect one for each question instead of scrambling to remember *something*.

## The Week Before Your Interview

Run this workflow:

```bash
# Generate fresh stories
repr generate --template interview --local

# Review what you have
repr stories

# Feature your top 5
repr story feature <id>
repr story feature <id>
repr story feature <id>
repr story feature <id>
repr story feature <id>

# Export to markdown
repr profile export --format md > interview-stories.md

# Export to JSON (easier to search)
repr profile export --format json > stories.json
```

Then spend 30 minutes reviewing your stories. Practice telling 2-3 of them out loud. You're ready.

## Real Talk: This Works

A good STAR story demonstrates:
- ✅ **Technical depth** (your Action shows you know your craft)
- ✅ **Business awareness** (your Result shows you think about impact)
- ✅ **Communication** (your Situation sets context for non-technical interviewers)
- ✅ **Self-awareness** (your Task shows you understand the problem)

Repr gives you the raw material. You add the polish. Together, you've got stories that stand out.

The alternative? Wing it and hope you remember something good under pressure. Don't do that. Generate your stories now, while the work is fresh. Future interview-you will thank you.
