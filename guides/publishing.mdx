You've been generating stories for a few weeks. You've got 20+ polished narratives about real work you've shipped. Now what?

You could keep them private (totally valid). Or you could **publish them** and create a living portfolio that actually reflects what you build.

Think of it as a developer portfolio that updates itself. No manual blog writing, no trying to remember what you did 6 months ago. Just your actual work, professionally summarized, ready to share.

Here's how to publish to repr.dev.

## When to Publish (And When Not To)

**Reasons to publish:**
- You're job hunting and want a portfolio beyond your resume
- You want to build a public track record of your work
- You're building in public and want to share progress
- You want a shareable link for your LinkedIn, Twitter, or newsletter

**Reasons to keep it private:**
- You work on confidential or proprietary code
- You're not comfortable with public profiles yet
- Your employer has policies against sharing work details
- You prefer repr as a personal journaling tool

Both are totally valid. Repr works great either way.

## The Publishing Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to repr.dev">
    First, you need an account:

    ```bash
    repr login
    ```

    This opens your browser with a device flow login (no password in your terminal). Authenticate, and you're done.

    ```text
    Opening browser for authentication...
    
    ✓ Successfully authenticated as you@example.com
    ✓ Token saved to system keychain
    ```

    Your auth token is stored in your OS keychain (same place your git credentials live), not in config files.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up your profile">
    Add some context about yourself:

    ```bash
    # Your professional bio
    repr profile set-bio "Full-stack engineer specializing in distributed systems and real-time infrastructure"

    # Location (optional)
    repr profile set-location "San Francisco, CA"

    # Are you open to opportunities?
    repr profile set-available true
    ```

    You can always change these later:

    ```bash
    repr profile set-available false  # No longer job hunting
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Curate what you'll share">
    Not every story should be public. Take a minute to review:

    ```bash
    repr stories
    ```

    Hide anything sensitive (internal project names, proprietary features, etc):

    ```bash
    repr story hide 01SENSITIVE_STORY_ID
    ```

    Feature your best 3-5 stories so they appear at the top:

    ```bash
    repr story feature 01BEST_STORY_ID
    repr story feature 01ANOTHER_GREAT_ONE
    ```

    Featured stories get pinned to the top of your profile and show up first when someone visits.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview before publishing">
    Always good to see what you're about to share:

    ```bash
    repr push --dry-run
    ```

    Output:
    ```text
    Preview: Publishing to repr.dev
    
    Profile:
      Name: Your Name
      Bio: Full-stack engineer specializing in distributed systems...
      Location: San Francisco, CA
      Available for work: Yes
    
    Stories (12 public, 3 hidden):
      Featured:
        • Built OAuth2 integration with Google/GitHub providers
        • Implemented Redis caching reducing API latency by 40%
        • Fixed critical race condition affecting 8% of users
      
      Recent:
        • Redesigned settings page with improved UX
        • Added dark mode with system preference detection
        • Implemented comprehensive API rate limiting
        ... (6 more)
    
    Hidden stories (not published):
      • Internal auth refactor for Project Redwood
      • Migrated user data to new schema
      • Fixed bug in proprietary recommendation engine
    
    Run without --dry-run to publish
    ```

    Look good? Ship it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish your stories">
    Send your curated stories to the cloud:

    ```bash
    repr push --all
    ```

    Output:
    ```text
    Publishing to repr.dev...
    
    ↑ Uploading 12 stories
    ↑ Updating profile
    
    ✓ Published successfully
    ✓ Profile URL: https://repr.dev/@yourusername
    ```

    That's it. Your profile is live.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share your link">
    Get your public profile URL:

    ```bash
    repr profile link
    ```

    Output:
    ```text
    Your public profile: https://repr.dev/@yourusername
    
    Add it to:
      • LinkedIn bio or summary
      • Twitter/X profile  
      • Email signature
      • Resume or portfolio site
    ```

    Copy that URL and share it wherever you want.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Your Profile Looks Like

When someone visits your profile, they'll see:

1. **Your bio and availability status**
2. **Featured stories** (pinned at the top)
3. **Recent stories** (chronological, newest first)
4. **Technologies you work with** (auto-extracted from stories)
5. **Activity timeline** (when you've been most active)

Hidden stories don't appear, but they're still saved locally on your machine.

## Keeping Your Profile Updated

You don't need to manually push every time. Here's a good workflow:

### Weekly Publishing Ritual

```bash
# Generate this week's stories
repr generate --local

# Review and curate
repr stories --needs-review
repr review  # Interactive mode

# Feature anything exceptional
repr story feature <id>

# Push new stories
repr push
```

Takes 5 minutes. Your profile stays current.

### Automatic Sync (Advanced)

Want your profile to auto-update? Set up a weekly sync:

```bash
# Pull any changes from cloud (if you edit on web)
# Generate new stories
# Push everything
repr sync
```

You can add this to a cron job or run it manually every Friday.

## Privacy Controls: What Gets Shared

Let's be explicit about what publishing means:

**What gets uploaded:**
- ✅ Story titles and narratives (the ones you approved)
- ✅ Technologies mentioned in stories
- ✅ Dates when work was done
- ✅ Your profile bio and settings

**What doesn't get uploaded:**
- ❌ Your source code (never)
- ❌ Commit messages or diffs (never)
- ❌ Repository names (unless mentioned in story narrative)
- ❌ Hidden stories
- ❌ Stories you haven't pushed

### Audit What You've Shared

Want to see exactly what data is on repr.dev?

```bash
repr privacy audit
```

Output:
```text
Network Activity Audit

Last sync: 2026-01-05 14:32:00
Account: you@example.com

Published data:
  • 12 stories (public)
  • 3 stories (hidden, not shown on profile)
  • 1 profile (bio, location, availability)

Recent API calls:
  • 2026-01-05 14:32 - POST /api/stories/push (12 stories)
  • 2026-01-03 09:15 - GET /api/profile/sync
  • 2026-01-01 16:45 - POST /api/stories/push (5 stories)

Total data uploaded: 127 KB
```

### Hide a Story After Publishing

Made a mistake? Realized a story has sensitive info?

```bash
repr story hide <id>
repr push
```

The story is immediately hidden from your public profile. It stays on your machine but won't show on repr.dev.

### Delete from Cloud Entirely

Want to remove a story from cloud storage completely?

```bash
repr story delete <id> --remote
```

This deletes it from your local machine **and** from repr.dev.

## Unpublish Everything

Changed your mind about having a public profile?

```bash
# Hide all stories (keeps them local)
repr privacy hide-all

# Or delete your entire profile
repr profile delete
```

Your local stories stay on your machine. Only the cloud copy is removed.

## Who Should Publish?

Honestly? **Most developers.**

Here's why: When you're job hunting, hiring managers google your name. They look at your GitHub, LinkedIn, maybe your personal site (if you have one). But GitHub just shows code—it doesn't show **context**.

A repr profile shows:
- What problems you've solved (not just code)
- How you think about your work (narratives, not just diffs)
- What you've actually shipped (stories with impact)
- Your technical breadth (technologies you've used)

It's like a blog, but it writes itself from your git history. Way lower effort, way more authentic than trying to maintain a dev blog.

## The Counter-Argument: Keep It Private

That said, some people prefer to keep repr purely private. That's valid too.

**Valid reasons to stay private:**
- You work on proprietary systems where you can't share details
- Your company has policies against public work discussions
- You want repr for personal reflection, not external signaling
- You're not comfortable with public profiles

Repr works great as a private journaling tool. Generate stories, export to markdown, keep it all local. No judgment.

## What's Next?

Once your profile is live:

- **Share it**: Add the link to your LinkedIn, Twitter, resume
- **Keep it current**: Push new stories weekly or monthly
- **Engage**: If someone reaches out via your profile, respond!
- **Iterate**: Feature your best work, hide the rest

Your repr profile is now a **living artifact** of what you build. Unlike a resume (static) or GitHub (raw code), it tells the story of your work.

And unlike a blog, it updates itself. Just keep shipping code, run `repr generate`, and push. Your portfolio maintains itself.
