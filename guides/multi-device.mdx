title: Multi-Device Sync

You code on your work laptop during the day. You hack on side projects from your desktop at home. You occasionally use your old MacBook when traveling.

Problem: Your repr stories are scattered across three machines. You can't remember which computer has which stories.

Solution: **Multi-device sync**. Sign in to the same account on all your devices, and repr keeps everything synchronized via the cloud.

## The Setup: Adding a New Device

Let's say you've been using repr on your work laptop. Now you want to add your home desktop.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install repr on the new device">
    Same as always:

    ```bash
    # macOS/Linux
    brew install repr

    # Or Python
    pipx install repr-cli
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize with your local repos">
    Point repr at your code folder:

    ```bash
    repr init ~/code
    ```

    This scans for git repositories on this machine. They don't have to be the same repos as your other device—repr is smart about merging stories from different repos.

    ```text
    Found 8 repositories
    ✓ side-project (87 commits) [TypeScript]
    ✓ personal-blog (34 commits) [Markdown]
    ✓ home-automation (56 commits) [Python]
    ...
    
    Track these repositories? [Y/n]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign in with your existing account">
    Use the **same account** you use on your other device:

    ```bash
    repr login
    ```

    This opens your browser for device flow authentication (no password in the terminal). Sign in, and you're connected.

    ```text
    Opening browser for authentication...
    
    ✓ Successfully authenticated as you@example.com
    ✓ Detected existing account with 23 stories
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pull your existing stories">
    Download all the stories from your other device(s):

    ```bash
    repr sync
    ```

    Output:
    ```text
    Syncing with repr.dev...
    
    ↓ Pulling remote changes
      • 23 stories from work-laptop
      • 5 stories from old-macbook
    
    ↑ Pushing local changes
      • 0 new stories (none generated yet on this device)
    
    ✓ Sync complete
    ✓ You now have 28 total stories across all devices
    ```

    Now your home desktop has all the stories you generated on your work laptop. Magic.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Daily Workflow: Staying in Sync

Once all your devices are connected to the same account, here's how to keep them synchronized.

### Option 1: Manual Sync (Recommended)

Start your day by pulling the latest:

```bash
repr pull
```

Do your work. Generate stories. When you're done for the day:

```bash
repr push
```

Or do both at once:

```bash
repr sync
```

Output:
```text
Syncing with repr.dev...

↓ Pulling remote changes
  • 3 new stories from work-laptop (generated yesterday)
  
↑ Pushing local changes  
  • 5 new stories from home-desktop (generated today)

✓ All stories synced
✓ Total: 36 stories across all devices
```

### Option 2: Automatic Sync with Git Hooks

You can hook repr sync into your git workflow. Add this to your shell config:

```bash
# In ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
alias gpp='git pull && repr pull'
alias gps='git push && repr push'
```

Now when you pull/push code, your stories sync too. Convenient.

### Option 3: Scheduled Sync (Advanced)

Want it completely automatic? Add a cron job or launchd service:

```bash
# Sync every hour (macOS with launchd)
repr hooks install-sync --schedule hourly

# Or manually with cron
0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/repr sync --quiet
```

Now your stories sync in the background. You don't have to think about it.

## Handling Conflicts

Repr is pretty smart about conflicts, but occasionally you'll edit the same story on two devices before syncing.

### The Default Strategy: Last Write Wins

If you edit story `01ABC...` on your laptop and the same story on your desktop, repr uses the **most recent** edit when you sync.

You'll see a warning:

```text
⚠ Conflict detected: Story 01ABC... edited on multiple devices
  Local version: 2026-01-05 14:32:00
  Remote version: 2026-01-05 16:45:00
  
  Using remote version (newer)
  Your local edits were backed up to ~/.repr/conflicts/
```

Your local version is saved to `~/.repr/conflicts/` just in case.

### Check Sync Status

Want to see what will happen before syncing?

```bash
repr status
```

Output:
```text
Repr Status

Auth: ✓ Signed in as you@example.com
Mode: Cloud (connected to repr.dev)

Tracked repos: 8
Total stories: 36

Sync status:
  ↓ 2 remote stories to pull
  ↑ 3 local stories to push
  ⚠ 1 conflict to resolve

Run 'repr sync' to synchronize
Run 'repr push --dry-run' to preview changes
```

### Preview Before Pushing

Always a good idea:

```bash
repr push --dry-run
```

Output:
```text
Preview: Push to repr.dev

Stories to upload:
  • Built OAuth2 integration (01ABC...)
  • Implemented Redis caching (01DEF...)  
  • Fixed auth race condition (01GHI...)

These will be available on all your devices after sync.

Run without --dry-run to push
```

## Multiple Repos Across Devices

Here's where it gets really powerful: **You don't need the same repos on all devices.**

Work laptop tracks:
- `~/work/api-service`
- `~/work/frontend-app`
- `~/work/infrastructure`

Home desktop tracks:
- `~/code/side-project`
- `~/code/open-source-contribution`
- `~/code/personal-site`

When you sync, repr merges stories from **all repos across all devices**. Your profile becomes a complete picture of everything you build, everywhere.

## The Multi-Device Power Move

Here's a workflow that really works:

1. **Work laptop**: Set up hooks, generate stories automatically during the week
2. **Friday afternoon**: Run `repr push` from your work laptop  
3. **Weekend**: Pull to your home desktop with `repr pull`
4. **Review and curate**: Polish stories, feature the best ones, export summaries
5. **Sunday night**: Push curated stories back with `repr push`
6. **Monday morning**: Pull to work laptop, your profile is polished and ready

Your stories flow between devices. You generate on one, curate on another, publish from either.

## Selective Sync (Advanced)

Don't want to sync everything? You can be selective:

```bash
# Only push specific stories
repr push --story 01ABC... --story 01DEF...

# Only pull, don't push
repr pull

# Only push, don't pull  
repr push

# Sync everything
repr sync
```

## Troubleshooting Sync Issues

### "Auth token expired"

Your login expired. Re-authenticate:

```bash
repr login
```

### "Conflict detected"

You edited the same story on multiple devices. Check the conflict directory:

```bash
ls ~/.repr/conflicts/
cat ~/.repr/conflicts/01ABC....json
```

Pick the version you want and manually restore it.

### "Sync failed: Network error"

Repr couldn't reach repr.dev. Check your connection:

```bash
repr doctor

# Or test connection directly
curl https://api.repr.dev/health
```

### "Stories out of sync"

Force a full sync:

```bash
repr sync --force
```

This re-downloads everything from the cloud and reconciles local stories.

## Privacy Note: What Gets Synced?

Let's be clear about what syncing means:

**What gets synced:**
- ✅ Your generated stories (titles, narratives, metadata)
- ✅ Story edits and curation (featured/hidden status)
- ✅ Profile settings (bio, location, availability)

**What doesn't get synced:**
- ❌ Your source code (never)
- ❌ Commit diffs (never)
- ❌ Repository contents (never)
- ❌ Git history (never)

Syncing uploads your **stories** (the LLM-generated narratives), not your code.

## When Multi-Device Sync Makes Sense

**Good fit:**
- You code on 2+ computers regularly
- You want a unified view of all your work
- You're comfortable with cloud sync

**Not necessary if:**
- You only code on one machine
- You prefer full local-only mode
- You manually export/import as needed

Multi-device sync is optional. Repr works great on a single device too.

## What's Next?

Once you've got sync working:

- **Weekly ritual**: Pull → Review → Feature → Push
- **Publishing**: Your stories are already synced, just run `repr push --all` to make your profile public
- **Backup**: Even with sync, run `repr data backup` occasionally for local backups

Sync gives you flexibility. Work from anywhere, your stories follow you.
