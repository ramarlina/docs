# Workflow Canvas

The **Workflow Canvas** is the visual pipeline where you build your professional profile and generate tailored application materials.

## Node-Based Editor

The canvas displays your data flow as connected **Nodes**. Data flows from left to right: inputs → processing → outputs.

### Input Nodes (Left Side)

These nodes gather "evidence" for your profile:

-   **GitHub Node**: Connect your GitHub account to import contribution data, pinned repositories, and activity metrics.
-   **CLI Node**: Shows repository profiles pushed from the `rf` command-line tool. Contains deep code analysis and metrics.
-   **LinkedIn Node**: Import your work history, education, and professional summary.
-   **Resume Node**: Upload existing resumes (PDF/DOCX) to extract and incorporate your previous content.
-   **Context Node**: Add supplementary materials:
    -   **Files**: Additional documents (certifications, portfolios)
    -   **Links**: Personal website, portfolio URLs
    -   **Notes**: Free-form text about your experience

### Generate Node (Center)

The central **Generate Profile** node synthesizes all input sources into a comprehensive professional profile. Click "Generate" to:
1.  Aggregate data from all connected input nodes
2.  Extract key accomplishments and skills
3.  Create a structured profile document

### Profile Node (Center-Right)

After generation, your **Profile** appears showing:
-   Profile summary and key highlights
-   Version history
-   View/download options

### Apply Node (Right)

Click **Apply to Job** to create a new application:
1.  Enter company name and paste job description
2.  The system analyzes requirements and matches against your profile
3.  Generates tailored materials automatically

### Application Pipeline

For each application, you'll see:
-   **Processing Node**: Shows real-time generation progress (Analyzing JD → Matching → Generating → Reviewing → Complete)
-   **Dossier Node**: Contains your generated materials:
    -   Tailored Resume
    -   Cover Letter
    -   Match Analysis (score, highlights, gaps)
    -   Screening Question Answers (if applicable)

## Building Your Workflow

1.  **Connect Data Sources**: Set up GitHub, upload resumes, add context
2.  **Generate Profile**: Click Generate to synthesize everything
3.  **Apply to Jobs**: Use Apply to create tailored applications
4.  **Track Progress**: Switch to Board view to manage your pipeline
