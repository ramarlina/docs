# Platform Overview

Repr is an **Application Engineering Platform**. It treats the job application process as an engineering problem: input (your experience), processing (matching & tailoring), and output (perfect application assets).

## The Core Loop

The platform operates on a simple but powerful loop:

1.  **Ingest**: We gather "evidence" of your skills from your code, LinkedIn, existing resumes, and notes.
2.  **Analyze**: We create a structured **Dossier**—a comprehensive database of your professional identity.
3.  **Match**: When you find a job, we analyze the description to understand what they *really* want.
4.  **Tailor**: We generate a bespoke resume and cover letter that maps your evidence to their requirements.

## Key Features

### [The Job Board](/platform/board)
Your central command center. Track every application from "Wishlist" to "Offer" in a visual Kanban view. Manage status, deadlines, and interview notes in one place.

### [Workflow Canvas](/platform/workflow-canvas)
The visual pipeline builder. Connect data nodes (GitHub, LinkedIn, CLI) to processing nodes (Match Analysis, Tailor) to generate custom assets for every single job.

### [CLI Integration](/platform/integration)
Bridge your local development environment with the cloud platform. Push code metrics and architectural analysis directly to your Dossier to prove your technical claims.
