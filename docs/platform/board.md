# The Job Board

The **Board** is your command center for managing the job search lifecycle. It provides a visual Kanban view of every role you are tracking, from initial input to final offer.

## Kanban Columns

The board is organized into stages that reflect the application pipeline:

1.  **To Generate**: Jobs you've added but haven't generated materials for yet.
2.  **Generating...**: Applications currently being processed by the AI.
3.  **Ready to Apply**: Materials are generated and ready for submission.
4.  **Applied**: Applications that have been submitted.
5.  **Interviewing**: Active interview loops (Screening, Technical, Onsite).
6.  **Offer**: Roles where you have received a formal offer.
7.  **Rejected**: Roles that didn't work out (for learning and future reference).

## Application Cards

Each card on the board represents a specific job opportunity. A card contains:

-   **Job Metadata**: Company name, Job title, and link to original posting.
-   **Match Score**: A dynamic 0-100% score indicating how well your profile fits the requirements.
-   **Match Highlights**: Key strengths that align with the role.
-   **Match Gaps**: Areas where the job requirements may not fully match your experience.
-   **Generation Status**: Progress indicator showing material generation steps.
-   **Generated Files**: Access to tailored resume, cover letter, match analysis, and more.

### Creating an Application

Click "New Application" and provide:
1.  Company name
2.  Job description (paste the full text)
3.  Job URL (optional)

The platform will automatically:
1.  Analyze the job description to extract requirements.
2.  Match your profile against those requirements.
3.  Generate tailored application materials (resume, cover letter, etc.).
4.  Calculate a Match Score with highlights and gaps.

### Drag & Drop

Cards can be dragged between columns to update their status as you progress through the application process.
